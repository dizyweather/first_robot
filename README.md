## Robot Guide

Hello!

This is a repo where I'm storing my software for the robot I'm creating following Articulated Robotics's amazing guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLunhqkrRNRhYAffV8JDiFOatQXuU-NnxT).

The reason I have this even public is that you probably won't have the same hardware and materials the guide has (at least I don't) so documenting the substitues, failures, and lessons learned from myself trying to will hopefully help others also intersted in building a robot. 2 references are better than 1! 

Here's the google docs with the [documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k6044f5tzpKZ12BtUt0AtrLESaISxcUilwZWQk4UKxA/edit#heading=h.njxg84dho4mp) of my experience (so far)
